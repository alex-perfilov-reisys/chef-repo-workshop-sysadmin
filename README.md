Welcome to Opscode's ChefConf Workshop!

This is the [Chef Repository](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Repository) for the system administrator focused workshop. It contains the cookbooks, roles and data bags required to set up the initial system used in the hands on exercises.

Copy this repository to your local system, for example to
`~/chefconf-sysadmin-chef-repo`.
